// Optimal renormalization of a frequency table down to a more coarse-grained
// table; through a combination of heuristics and memoization, finds the
// rounding that produces the fewest amount of bits needed to encode, while
// making sure no symbol gets a frequency of zero. Primarily useful for when
// your precision is low enough that loss is a real problem; compared to direct
// rounding, it tends to cut the overhead about in half.
//
// This operation is cheap but not free; it seems to use 1â€“2 ms on a Haswell 2.1 GHz
// for 256 symbols (the speed is mostly dependent on number of symbols, although
// number of bits also matters some).
